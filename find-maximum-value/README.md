# find-maximum-value
We have to know how to deal with nodes, BinaryTree and Queue.

## Challenge
Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
## Efficiency
### Big O :

- find-maximum-value : Time --> O(n) because i used the recursive function,
                       Space --> O(n) because i used the recursive function
