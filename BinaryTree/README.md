# Breadth-first Traversal.
We have to know how to deal with nodes, BinaryTree and Queue.

## Challenge
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.

## Approach & Efficiency
## Efficiency
### Big O :

- Binary Tree : Time --> O(n), Space --> O(n)
- breadthFirst : Time --> O(n), Space --> O(n)
