# Trees
We have to know how to deal with nodes and tree.

## Challenge
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
- Create a BinaryTree class.
- Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
- Create a BinarySearchTree class
- Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
- Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Approach & Efficiency
## Efficiency
### Big O :

- Binary Tree : Time --> O(n), Space --> O(n)
- Binary Search Tree : Time --> O(n), Space --> O(n)
The recursive method has a time and space efficiency of O(n).
