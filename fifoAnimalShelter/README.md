# First-in, First out Animal Shelter.
We have to know how to deal with stack and queue and what is the structure of it.

## Challenge
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
Implement the following methods:
- enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
- dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## Approach & Efficiency
## Efficiency
### Big O :
- Space : O(n)
- Time : O(n), Because I used loops.
