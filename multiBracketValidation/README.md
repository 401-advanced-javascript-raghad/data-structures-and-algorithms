# Stacks and Queues
We have to know how to deal with stack and queue and what is the structure of it.

## Challenge
Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

- Round Brackets : ()
- Square Brackets : []
- Curly Brackets : {}

## Approach & Efficiency
## Efficiency
### Big O :

- Space : O(n), Because I create a stack of opening brackets whose size is dependent on the input,
- Time : O(n), Because I used loops.
