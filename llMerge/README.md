# Challenge Summary
We will write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.

## Challenge Description
We have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach & Efficiency
## Approach:
- I created function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as an argument and Zip the two linked lists together into one.
## Efficiency : Big O => 
- mergeLists() =>  Time: O(n) , Space: O(n)
